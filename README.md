react-app-rewire-babel-loader [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-app-rewire-babel-loader.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewire-babel-loader)
=============================

> Rewire [`babel-loader`](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) loader in your [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project using [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

Say there is an awesome library you found on npm that you want to use within your **un-ejected**  [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project, but unfortunately, it's published in ES6+ (since `node_modules` doesn't go through `babel-loader`), so you cannot *really* use it.

However, with [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and this library, `react-app-rewire-babel-loader`, you can use that awesome library you've found.

See below for usage.

## ðŸš¨ Not maintained for react-app-rewired v2.x.x+

I'm not maintaining this library for `react-app-rewired` v2.x.x+.

Instead, please consider using: https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra

The following essentially emulates `react-app-rewire-babel-loader` which you can copy & paste into your override config file:

```js
// NOTE as of customize-cra v0.2.11

const { babelInclude, getBabelLoader } = require("customize-cra");

const include = (config, ...includes) => {
    return babelInclude(includes)(config);
};

const babelExclude = exclude => config => {
  getBabelLoader(config).exclude = exclude;
  return config;
};

const exclude = (config, ...excludes) => {
    return babelExclude(excludes)(config);
};
```

## Install


```sh
$ yarn add react-app-rewire-babel-loader
# npm v5+
$ npm install react-app-rewire-babel-loader
# before npm v5
$ npm install --save react-app-rewire-babel-loader
```

## Usage

```js
// config-overrides.js
// see: https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired

const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const rewireBabelLoader = require("react-app-rewire-babel-loader");

// helpers

const appDirectory = fs.realpathSync(process.cwd());
const resolveApp = relativePath => path.resolve(appDirectory, relativePath);

module.exports = function override(config, env) {

  // white-list some npm modules to the babel-loader pipeline
  // see: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-include

  config = rewireBabelLoader.include(
    config,
    resolveApp("node_modules/isemail")
  );

  // black-list some modules from the babel-loader pipeline
  // see: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-exclude

  config = rewireBabelLoader.exclude(
    config,
    /(node_modules|bower_components)/
  );

  return config;

};
```
