This is a port of [react-app-rewire-babel-loader](https://github.com/dashed/react-app-rewire-babel-loader) to [`CRACO`](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) instead of [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired). `react-app-rewired` is not being updated for version 2 of CRA, and I wanted to use the rewired babel loader with a solution designed for CRA 2.

> Rewire [`babel-loader`](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) loader in your [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project using [`CRACO`](https://github.com/sharegate/craco).

Say there is an awesome library you found on npm that you want to use within your **un-ejected**  [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project, but unfortunately, it's published in ES6+ (since `node_modules` doesn't go through `babel-loader`), so you cannot *really* use it.

However, with [`CRACO`](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) and this library, `craco-babel-loader`, you can use that awesome library you've found.

See below for usage.

## ðŸš¨ Not maintained for react-app-rewired v2.x.x+

I'm not maintaining this library for `react-app-rewired` v2.x.x+.

Instead, please consider using: https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra

The following essentially emulates `react-app-rewire-babel-loader` which you can copy & paste into your override config file:

```js
// NOTE as of customize-cra v0.2.11

const { babelInclude, getBabelLoader } = require("customize-cra");

const include = (config, ...includes) => {
    return babelInclude(includes)(config);
};

const babelExclude = exclude => config => {
  getBabelLoader(config).exclude = exclude;
  return config;
};

const exclude = (config, ...excludes) => {
    return babelExclude(excludes)(config);
};
```

## Install


```sh
$ yarn add craco-babel-loader
# npm v5+
$ npm install craco-babel-loader
# before npm v5
$ npm install --save craco-babel-loader
```

## Usage

```js
// crago.config.js
// see: https://github.com/sharegate/craco

const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

const rewireBabelLoader = require("craco-babel-loader");

// helpers

const appDirectory = fs.realpathSync(process.cwd());
const resolveApp = relativePath => path.resolve(appDirectory, relativePath);

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
        //This is a craco plugin: https://github.com/sharegate/craco/blob/master/packages/craco/README.md#configuration-overview
        { plugin: rewireBabelLoader, 
          options: { 
            includes: [resolveApp("node_modules/isemail")], //put things you want to include in array here
            excludes: [/(node_modules|bower_components)/] //things you want to exclude here
            //you can omit include or exclude if you only want to use one option
          }
        }
    ]
}

```
